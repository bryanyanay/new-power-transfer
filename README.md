This is me rebuilding the power transfer app from scratch, as a review of React, Next.js, YugabyteDB, Hasura, Auth0, Typescript, etc.

This time I'm planning on using Tailwind CSS and docker as well.

### Useful commands
 - `npm run dev` to start up the dev server, with hot reloading and the like

 - [ ] add one for building the image using the dockerfile and running the container
